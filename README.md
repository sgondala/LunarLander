Instructions to run -

I have already trained the model and saved it under weights/.
To test the code, you can run 'python3 reinforce_tf.py' 

When you execute it, by default the program is in test mode. 
It loads the trained weights into the NN and runs 100 trails using this trained NN and prints the score values for those 100 runs.

If you want to train it, open the file, uncomment the last line and comment out 3 lines above it.
